In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the `app` directory's new routing system if you're not careful about your file structure and how you handle dynamic routes.  For example, if you have a page at `/blog/[slug]/comments` and you try to access a file or a directory at `/blog/[slug]/comments/something` where something is not also a dynamic route segment, you will run into an unexpected 404 error.  The router does not handle nested segments correctly in the same way that it does when they are part of a defined route pattern.
